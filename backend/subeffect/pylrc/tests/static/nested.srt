1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Artist M2M

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,659
HIM

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,649
Well I wonder could it be

4
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,239
When I was dreaming
about you baby

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,149
You were dreaming of me

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,719
Call me crazy,Call me blind

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,609
To still be suffering is
stupid after all of this time

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,309
Did I lose my love
to someone better

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,099
And does she love you like I do

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,289
I do, you know I
really really do

11
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,979
Well hey,So much I need to say

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,379
Been lonely since the day

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,669
The day you went away

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,859
So sad but true

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,259
For me there's only you

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,749
Been crying since the day

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:20,809
the day you went away

18
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,919
I remember date and time

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,809
September twenty second

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,799
Sunday twenty five after nine

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,299
In the doorway with your case

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,679
No longer shouting
at each other

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,879
There were tears on our faces

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,469
And we were letting go
of something special

25
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,559
Something we'll
never have again

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,459
I know, I guess I
really really know

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,149
Well hey,So much I need to say

28
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,939
Been lonely since the day

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,929
The day you went away

30
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,319
So sad but true

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,519
For me there's only you

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,309
Been crying since the day

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:26,969
the day you went away

34
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,359

to someone better

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,359
And does she love you like I do

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,439

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,049
Well hey,So much I need to say

38
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,529
Been lonely since the day

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,629
The day you went away

40
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,019
So sad but true

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,609
For me there's only you

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,709
Been crying since the day

43
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,899
the day you went away

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,789
Why do we never know what
we've got till it's gone

45
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,079
How could I carry on
the day you went away

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,969
Cause I've been missing
you so much I have to say

47
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,459
Been crying since the day

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,459
