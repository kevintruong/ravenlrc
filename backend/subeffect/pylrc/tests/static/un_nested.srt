1
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,119
You get up every morning,

2
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,049
From your alarm
clock's warning,

3
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,969
Take the 8:15 into the city.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,449
There's a whistle up above,

6
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,499
And people pushin',
people shovin',

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,359
And the girls who
try to look pretty.

9
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,089
And if your train's on time,

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,319
You can get to work by nine,

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,879
And start your slavin'
job to get your pay.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,559
If you ever get annoyed,

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,789
Look at me I'm self-employed.

15
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,149
I love to work at
nothing all day.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,109
And I'll be Takin' Care
Of Business, every day!

23
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,589
If it were easy as fishin',

24
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,709
You could be a musician,

25
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,509
If you could make
sounds loud or mellow.

27
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,869
Get a second-hand guitar.

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,919
Chances are you'll go far,

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,709
If you get in with the
right bunch of fellows.

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,439
People see you having fun,

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,669
Just a-lying in the sun.

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,849
Tell them that you
like it this way.

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,709
It's the work that we avoid.

36
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,879
