[00:19.66]Well I wonder could it be
[00:23.65]When I was dreaming about you baby
[00:27.24]You were dreaming of me
[00:29.15]Call me crazy,Call me blind
[00:33.72]To still be suffering is stupid after all of this time
[00:39.61][02:26.97]Did I lose my love to someone better
[00:43.31][02:30.36]And does she love you like I do
[00:46.10][02:33.36]I do, you know I really really do
[00:50.29][01:51.46][02:37.44]Well hey,So much I need to say
[00:53.98][01:55.15][02:41.05]Been lonely since the day
[00:56.38][01:57.94][02:43.53]The day you went away
[00:59.67][02:00.93][02:46.63]So sad but true
[01:01.86][02:03.32][02:49.02]For me there's only you
[01:04.26][02:05.52][02:51.61][03:11.97]Been crying since the day
[01:06.75][02:08.31][02:53.71][03:14.46]the day you went away
[01:20.81]I remember date and time
[01:24.92]September twenty second
[01:27.81]Sunday twenty five after nine
[01:30.80]In the doorway with your case
[01:35.30]No longer shouting at each other
[01:38.68]There were tears on our faces
[01:40.88]And we were letting go of something special
[01:44.47]Something we'll never have again
[01:47.56]I know, I guess I really really know
[02:56.90]Why do we never know what we've got till it's gone
[03:01.79]How could I carry on the day you went away
[03:07.08]Cause I've been missing you so much I have to say
